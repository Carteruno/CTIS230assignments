 <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
 
 <p>I like to draw, so <strong>Pinterest</strong> allows me to see art I would otherwise not encounter organically. <strong>Discord</strong>is a platform more than an in-browser page, but is accessible by the browser. You have to make an account to view what the platform is like. While <strong>Discord</strong> may technically not be what this question was intended for, It is a platform with strong UI and organization. <strong>Discord's</strong> primary function is to serve as social media.</p>
 
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

 <p>The difference between it and <strong>Twitter</strong> is its tight knit communities. There is no open feed that you scroll, rather you seek out communities through its integrated browser for server chats that reflect a niche interest, hobby or group. Many servers I am in have brought me to likeminded people with similar hobbies and interests. The way <strong>Discord</strong> is setup allows a server owner to customize and organize a server neatly. Channels are subcategories of the server where certain things are shared. For example, a channel named <i>“media”</i> isn't for day to day conversations, it's for sharing music, images, files etc. General chat is another channel, that is where people have normal conversations. You can have a large number of channels for many different purposes.
