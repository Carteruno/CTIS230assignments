 <h1> Welcome to Carter Webb's Second Web(b) Page!</h1>

 <h1>Introduction</h1>

 <p>I arrived wrapped in cellophane upon the doorstep of a place not shortly after my conception, something grabs and rips open the plastic prison to reveal a dim lit room and a bucked teeth fella. He grinned at my visage and began to flip through my pages in a thrill. He quickly put me down and displayed me propped up on a computer desk facing outward. The year was maybe 2020, and I never expected to be around for 5 more years to come.</p> 
 
 <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>

 <p>I realized this young fella was very anxious and to himself, I see him in his own room a lot, maybe a bit too much for a social animal like a human being. He plays lots of video games and sometimes sits close to me to do what I presume is a sort of chore or study. The room is without windows so I never know the time of day, but I do know he is up longer than he should be and sleeps too little.</p>
 
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

 <p>I notice he leaves really early in the morning with a backpack strap. He returns home very anxious and usually starts watching something on the <em>television</em> or plays some mindless game to distract from it all. Whenever he reads those big books or types on the keyboard with that vain look, I can see he doesn't seem to enjoy his educational experience so far. He comes back late on the weekends and leaves for those moments of time in a uniform with a hat very begrudgingly.</p>

 <h4>In Conclusion Continued...</h4>
 
 <p>A year or so and this is the usual case. He gets up really early with the book strap, comes back to either his computer, <em>television</em>, and sometimes me. I noticed he actually started picking me over other activities, even when he ought to be reading those big books. I can tell when he does things he shouldnâ€™t just by that look he has and the way he will lose himself in other things. He seems to greatly prefer his time doing anything other than confronting those books or whatever he does on that keyboard. He clacks away in vain, though I can not see what it is he types or views, not that I can read anyway.</p>
