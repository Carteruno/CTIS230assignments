 <h1> Welcome to Carter Webb's Web(b) Page!</h1>

 <h1>Introduction</h1>

 <p> A few websites I frequent are <strong>Pinterest</strong>, <strong>New Masters academy</strong>, <strong>youtube</strong>, <strong>Discord</strong> and a few others. My favorites are <strong>Pinterest</strong> and <strong>Discord</strong>. <strong>Pinterest</strong> is a platform that curates algorithms to show you images you may like. <strong>Pinterest</strong> tunes a home feed of tailored images based on what you click. You can add images to collage boards for organized reference in the future, which further tunes your feed and provides a unique feed for each board.</p> 
 
 <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>

 <p>I like to draw, so <strong>Pinterest</strong> allows me to see art I would otherwise not encounter organically. <strong>Discord</strong> is a platform more than an in-browser page, but is accessible by the browser. You have to make an account to view what the platform is like. While <strong>Discord</strong> may technically not be what this question was intended for, It is a platform with strong UI and organization. <strong>Discord's</strong> primary function is to serve as social media.</p>
 
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

 <p>The difference between it and <strong>Twitter</strong> is its tight knit communities. There is no open feed that you scroll, rather you seek out communities through its integrated browser for server chats that reflect a niche interest, hobby or group. Many servers I am in have brought me to likeminded people with similar hobbies and interests. The way <strong>Discord</strong> is setup allows a server owner to customize and organize a server neatly. Channels are subcategories of the server where certain things are shared. For example, a channel named <i>“media”</i> isn't for day to day conversations, it's for sharing music, images, files etc. General chat is another channel, that is where people have normal conversations. You can have a large number of channels for many different purposes.</p>
